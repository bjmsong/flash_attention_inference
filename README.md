# Flash Attention Inference
## Flash Attention Optimization
Performance of the C++ interface of Flash Attention and Flash Attention v2 in large language model (LLM) inference scenarios. The calculation expression is as follows, where the precision of tensor Q, K, V and O is FP16. Remove redundant code from Flash Attention that has nothing to do with inference, such as backward, dropout, bf16 and torch dependencies, so you can easily integrate this Flash Attention into LLM inference programs. In addition, Flash Attention and Flash Attention v2 have been modified to support group query attention (GQA) / multi query attention (MQA), hybrid by prefill and decoding and attention with linear biases (ALiBi) inference scenarios.
```
O = Softmax(Q * K^T) * V
```

## Decoding attention
Decoding attention is specially optimized for multi head attention (MHA) using CUDA core for the decoding stage of LLM inference. It mainly refers to OpenPPL and Flash Attention, which can solve the problem of low tensor core utilization of Flash Attention in the decoding stage of LLM inference and support more types of attention and quantization optimization. The calculation expression is as follows, where the precision of tensor Q, K, V and O is FP16. In most LLM inference decoding scenarios, the performance of Decoding Attention is better than Flash Attention and Flash Attention v2. In addition, Decoding Attention also supports GQA / MQA and ALiBi inference scenarios.

## Decoding attention Quantization
At the same time, various quantization methods were explored for KV cache in Decoding Attention, which can save nearly half of the GPU memory and reduce the cost of LLM inference. 

### Int8 Quantization
Usually, there are the following 4 types of int8 quantization schemes for KV cache:
- Per Tensor: Uniform quantization of K or V of all tokens
- Per Token: Uniform quantization of K or V of a certain token
- Per Head: Uniform quantization of K or V of a certain head of a certain token
- Per Group: Group quantization of K or V of a certain head of a certain token

The Per Tensor solution has high GPU memory benefits, but the accuracy may drop significantly; the Per Group solution has high accuracy, but the scale storage capacity is large, and the GPU memory benefits are not high. Here, in order to take into account both quantization accuracy and memory gain, Per Headâ€™s quantization scheme was chosen.

### FP8 Quantization
In addition, I also tried to use the quantization method of directly converting KV cache to FP8, including E5M2 and E4M3 formats. I found that the quantization accuracy of FP8 is better than that of int8, and there is no need to store additional scale, which means that the GPU memory benefit of FP8 will be greater big. The quantization and dequantization process of FP8 is also relatively elegant and can be integrated into Decoding Attention.
